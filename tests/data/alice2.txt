There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so verry much out of the way
to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thaught it over
afterwards, it occured to her that she ought to have wonderd at this, but at the time it all
seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actualy took a wach out of its waiscoat poket, and
looked at it, and then huried on, Alice started to her feete, for it flashed accross her mind that
she had never before seen a rabbit with ether a waiscoat poket, or a wach to take out of it, and
burning with curiositie, she ran accross the feild after it, and fortunatly was just in time to see
it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the the hedge.

In another moment down whent Alice after it, never once consedering how in the world she was to get
out agian.

The rabbit-hole whent straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped sudenly down, so
sudenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stoping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.

Eether the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she whent down
to look about her and to wonder what was going to hapen next. First, she tryed to look down and
make out what she was comeing to but it was to dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides
of the well, and notised that they were filled with cuboards and bookshelvs; here and there she
saw maps and pictures hung uppon pegs. She toock down a jar from one of the shelvs as she passed; it
was labeld “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great dissapointment it was empty: she did not like to
drop the jar for feer of killing sombody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cuboards
as she fell past it.
