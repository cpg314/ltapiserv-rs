There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way
to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, and
looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see
it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get
out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so
suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down
to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and
make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides
of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she
saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it
was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards
as she fell past it.
